# Difference between Absolute and Relative positioning :-

# Absolute and relative positioning are two fundamental concepts in CSS that allow you to precisely control the layout and positioning of elements on a web page.

# Absolute positioning :- An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.

# Absolute Positioning features :
a). Element's Default Behavior :-
# An element with absolute positioning is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (parent element) or, if none exist, relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element).

b). Offset Properties :-
# Like with relative positioning, you can use properties like top, bottom, left, and right to precisely position an element.

c). Interaction with Sibling Elements :-
# Elements with absolute positioning are taken out of the normal document flow. They do not affect the layout of sibling elements, and sibling elements do not affect their position.

d). Interaction with Relative Positioning :-
# If a child element is set to absolute positioning within a relatively positioned parent element, it will be positioned relative to the parent, not the document.

# Scrolling Behavior :-
# Absolute positioned elements do not move when the page is scrolled. They remain fixed in their specified position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

# Synatx 
  position: absolute;

# Relative positioning :- Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.

# Relative Positioning features :-

a). Element's Default Behavior :-
# An element with relative positioning is initially positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
It will still take up space in the document flow, and other elements will be positioned as if it were in its default position.

b). Offset Properties :-
# When you apply relative positioning to an element, you can use properties like top, bottom, left, and right to offset it from its normal position.

c). Interaction with Sibling Elements :-
# Sibling elements are not affected by an element with relative positioning. They will be positioned as if the element with relative positioning is in its default position.

d). Interaction with Absolute Positioning :-
# If a child element is set to absolute positioning within a relatively positioned parent element, it will be positioned relative to the parent, not the document.

e). Scrolling Behavior :-
# If the page is scrolled, the element with relative positioning will move along with the rest of the page.

# Syntax:
  position: relative;
