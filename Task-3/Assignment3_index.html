        Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet
        from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to
        host life. With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest
        planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have
        liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers.
        Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity,
        but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our
        world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.
        Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. Since our calendar years
        have only 365 days, we add an extra leap day every four years to account
        for the difference. Though we can't feel it, Earth zooms through its
        orbit at an average velocity of 18.5 miles a second. During this
        circuit, our planet is an average of 93 million miles away from the sun,
        a distance that takes light about eight minutes to traverse. Astronomers
        define this distance as one astronomical unit (AU), a measure that
        serves as a handy cosmic yardstick.
